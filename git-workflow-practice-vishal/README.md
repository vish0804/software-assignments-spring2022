# Software Engineering

I find this article interesting because it explains what software engineering is but also states thats the specific techniques, methods, and processes used in software engineering is *not stated*, and the books never really mention them. This is the case I assume because the field of computer science is so vast, and there are so many different approaches based on different questions. I also think of software engineering a little different when the author says it is an **artifical** science, whereas physics and chemistry are **natural sciences**.

## Comment from Michael Thuo
I also thought this article was interesting because the author claims that the title of software engineering is a misnomer, and that actual software production has little to do with engineering. He goes on to say that since software projects vary so much, grouping them all together under one term is not helpful. It's also important to consider that this article is from 2001, so it's definitely a little outdated since the tech field changes so fast. I wonder what the author would say about software engineering today.
